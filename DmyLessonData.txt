        # About Branching
        
        *Branching* is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Branching in other VCS's can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.
        
        ## Branching - Visualization
        
        The graphic below depicts a repository with two separate development lines, one for a small feature and the other for a longer-running feature. It's not only possible to work on both of them in parallel while they're developed in branches, but it also keeps \`main\` branch clear of problematic code.`

        text: `# What a Branch represents

        A *branch* represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.
        
        # Common Options
        
        1. \`git branch\` List all of the branches in your repository. This is synonymous with \`git branch --list.\`
        2. \`git branch <branch>\` Create a new branch called \`＜branch＞\`. This does **not** check out the new branch.
        3. \`git branch -d <branch>\` Delete the specified branch. This is a “safe” operation in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.
        4. \`git branch -D <branch>\` Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.
        5. \`git branch -m <branch>\` Rename the current branch to \`＜branch＞\`.
        6. \`git branch -a\`List all remote branches.`

        text: `# Creating remote branches

        So far these examples have all demonstrated local branch operations. The \`git branch\` command also works on remote branches. In order to operate on remote branches, a remote repo must first be configured and added to the local repo config.
        
        \`\`\`
        $ git remote add new-remote-repo https://bitbucket.com/user/repo.git
        # Add remote repo to local repo config
        $ git push <new-remote-repo> crazy-experiment~
        # pushes the crazy-experiment branch to new-remote-repo
        \`\`\`
        
        This command will push a copy of the local branch \`crazy-experiment\` to the remote repo \`＜remote＞.\`
        
        # Deleting Branches
        
        Once you’ve finished working on a branch and have merged it into the main code base, you’re free to delete the branch without losing any history:
        
        \`\`\`
        git branch -d crazy-experiment
        \`\`\`
        
        However, if the branch hasn’t been merged, the above command will output an error message:
        
        \`\`\`
        error: The branch 'crazy-experiment' is not fully merged. If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D crazy-experiment'.
        \`\`\`
        
        This protects you from losing access to that entire line of development. If you really want to delete the branch (e.g., it’s a failed experiment), you can use the capital \`-D\` flag:
        
        \`\`\`
        git branch -D crazy-experiment
        \`\`\`
        
        This deletes the branch regardless of its status and without warnings, so use it judiciously.
        
        The previous commands will delete a local copy of a branch. The branch may still exist in remote repos. To delete a remote branch execute the following.
        
        \`git push origin --delete crazy-experiment\`
        
        Or
        
        \`\`\`
        git push origin :crazy-experiment
        \`\`\`
        
        This will push a delete signal to the remote origin repository that triggers a delete of the remote \`crazy-experiment\` branch.`
